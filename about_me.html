           I am a second year, Interactive Digital Media student at the Westphal College of 
           Media Arts and Design of Drexel University. I am currently expanding my knowledge
           in the field with the help of many professional and student mentors. I enjoy the 
           processes of thinking, organizing, managing, and communicating. I love music, the 
           rain, and NYC.
        </p>
        <p class="me_para" id="para2">
          I also want to give back to the community. Though I am only a student whose main goal 
          is to excel academically in preparation for the professional world, I really hope 
          to adapt a mindset of understanding my privilege and what I can do with that privilege 
          to help others.
